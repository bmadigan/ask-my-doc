- Field mapping between sources
- Data filtering and validation
- Format conversions

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Errors
If you see "Connection Failed":
1. Verify your credentials are correct
2. Check that the service is accessible
3. Ensure firewall rules allow connections
4. Try the "Test Connection" button

### Performance Issues
